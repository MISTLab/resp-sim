-- Code to export SystemC and TLM (and also their start_decls) should be centralized and executed for each pypp task
-- TRAP library should not be used, we should just need the headers
-- Modify Py++ in order to expose also private members (with the #define private protected trick)
-- Check restaart in 64 bits patch: it explodes at the restart
-- Check and change the memory analyzer with the one of TRAP
-- Integrate the BFD frontend in the executable loader
