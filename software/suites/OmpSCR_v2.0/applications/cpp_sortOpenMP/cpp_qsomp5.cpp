 * Originally written for the EWOMP'04 in Stockholm, this program is part of
 * a larger collection of programs, which were written to discover some
 * problems with the present state of the OpenMP-specification.
 *
 * @attention Although this code will run on any specification-compliant
 * OpenMP-compiler, many compilers will serialize the nested parallel regions,
 * which means that you will not see a speedup bigger than 2 with them!
 * The only compiler I am presently aware of that has "proper" nesting support

  COMMENTS:          Version 5: Although this code will run on any specification-compliant
                     OpenMP-compiler, many compilers will serialize the nested parallel regions,
                     which means that you will not see a speedup bigger than 2 with them!
