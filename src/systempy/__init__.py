""" A Python-SystemC Wrapper

    This package is used as an interoperability and scriptability layer
    between python and SystemC. The idea is to allow the creation of systemc
    modules, to start and stop the simulation and so on and so forth.
    It would be interesting if this should be included in the C++ part...
