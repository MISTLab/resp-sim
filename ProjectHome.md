ReSP is an MPSoC simulation platform working at a high abstraction level; components used by ReSP are based on SystemC and TLM hardware and communication description libraries. ReSP provides a non-intrusive framework to manipulate SystemC and TLM objects. The simulation platform is built using Python programming language; its reflective capabilities augment the platform with the possibility of observing the internal structure of the SystemC component models. This feature enables run-time composition and dynamic management of the architecture under analysis. The full potentialities offered by the integration among Python and SystemC are exploited, during simulation, to query, examine and, possibly, modify the internal status of the hardware models. These capabilities simplify the debugging process for both the modeled hardware architecture and the software running on it.

In order to add reflective capabilities to C++, wrappers around SystemC components must be created; they allow interoperability between C++ and Python languages. These wrappers are automatically created using Py++ tool.
