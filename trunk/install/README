These are scripts for easier installation of ReSP dependent software on
some popular Linux distributions, namely Ubuntu and CentOS.

To install, run the scripts in ReSP's root directory (i.e. one up from
where this file is located).
Please note that all scripts require root access to your machine, and
in particular the Ubuntu scripts via sudo, and the CentOS one via the
user who is running the script.
