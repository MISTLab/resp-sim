#This file contains a simple architecture composed of a master and a slave; they exchange characters. Trough this file it
#is possible to test if the setup was succesfull

#Creation of the master and slave components; note how what we do is actually calling the constructor of the classes. The
#call here is performed in python, and this in turn calls the C++ constructor. These python constructors indeed have
#the same signature of the c++ ones
instMaster = testMaster_wrapper.testMaster('master')
instSlave = testSlave_wrapper.testSlave('slave')

#Connection of the ports: first we specify the source component and its ports; then the target component and its port.
connectPortsForce(instMaster, instMaster.initSocket, instSlave, instSlave.targetSocket)

import breakpoints
register_breakpoint(instMaster, 'count', breakpoints.equals(5))
