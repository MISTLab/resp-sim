 *
 * Originally written for the EWOMP'04 in Stockholm, this program is part of
 * a larger collection of programs, which were written to discover some
 * problems with the present state of the OpenMP-specification.
 *
 * @attention You need a compiler that supports the OpenMP--workqueuing model
 * (not part of the standard yet) such as the Intel Compiler 7.0 or later or
 * certain versions of the SUN-Compiler. Also note that the Intel compiler
 * has a special syntax (#pragma intel omp taskq) for the workqueuing model.
