Patch to the SystemC configuration files; this patch applies to SystemC version 2.2.0.
the patch was created with command "diff -crB"; in order to apply the patch "patch -p0 -i configure.in.patch"

This patch solves the following issues:

-- Adds the -fPIC flags to all targets so that shared libraries can be created out of the compiled object files
(actually this is necessary only for 64 bits targets)
-- Adds a i686-apple-macosx target, so that is compiles on intel apple machines.
-- enables the compilation for compilers called g++... (e.g. g++-4.2) and not just for plain g++

After patching, execute, in sequence, the following commands: aclocal, automake --add-missing --copy, autoconf.
You should then be able to succesfully compile SystemC.

On Mac-OSX targets you also need to specify the build type since the system is not able to determine it automatically:
pass the --build=i686-apple-macosx option to the configure command. You also need to patch file 
src/sysc/kernel/sc_cor_qt.h by adding the instruction typedef char* caddr_t; at line 85.

One final note: current version of SystemC does not compile with g++ version 4.3 and greater. In order to correct this
go in folder systemc-2.2.0/src/sysc/utils and modify file sc_utils_ids.cpp adding #include <cstdlib> and #include <cstring> at the among the
includes.
