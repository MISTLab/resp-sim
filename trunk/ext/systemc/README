Patch to the SystemC configuration files; this patch applies to SystemC version 2.2.0.
the patch was created with command "diff -crB"; in order to apply the patch "patch -p0 -i configure.in.patch"

This patch solves the following issues:

-- Adds the -fPIC flags to all targets so that shared libraries can be created out of the compiled object files
(actually this is necessary only for 64 bits targets)
-- Adds a i686-apple-macosx target, so that is compiles on intel apple machines
-- enables the compilation for compilers called g++... (e.g. g++-4.2) and not just for plain g++
