-- Clean-up pypp, eliiminating the dead code, the old and useless commented code, etc (e.g. is ext_headers
dead code?)
-- Modify pypp so that only a single header file is created in case the task have multiple headers (this header
file includes all the other headers); this way gccxml is executed only one on that created header file
and also it should be easier to specify the #define protected private trick
-- Modify the pypp task, so that if systemc or tlm wrappers change, all the modules including such
wrapper should also be rebuilt
-- compute pypp task dependences, so that only tasks with the same includes are serialized
-- Modify Py++ in order to expose also private members (with the #define private protected trick)
-- Check restaart in 64 bits patch: it explodes at the restart
-- Check and change the memory analyzer with the one of TRAP
